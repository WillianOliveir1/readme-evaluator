**Gemini vs Manual Evaluator**

## CONTRIBUTION

### Notas (Quality Metrics)

| Métrica | Gemini | Manual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| clarity | 5 | 3 | ⚠️ |
| readability | 5 | 3 | ⚠️ |
| structure | 5 | 3 | ⚠️ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> A clear link to a dedicated contributing guide is provided. The README explicitly lists various ways to contribute beyond just code, which is highly encouraging and inclusive. While specific coding standards are not detailed, the section encourages new contributors and links to a general guide, making it very readable and clear.

**Manual:**
> Structure exists but acts as a signpost rather than a summary. Clear where to find guidelines; steps are not summarized. Readable but minimal content.

**Status:** ⚠️ Justificativas diferem

## HOW CONFIG REQUIREMENTS

### Notas (Quality Metrics)

| Métrica | Gemini | Manual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| clarity | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| conciseness | 1 | 0 | ⚠️ |
| structure | 1 | 1 | ✅ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> No information regarding configuration or system requirements beyond general OS compatibility is provided. This section is completely absent, hence structure and conciseness cannot be evaluated positively. There is no troubleshooting guidance present in the README.

**Manual:**
> Users are not informed about core requirements in README. No dedicated section or inline content to structure configuration info. No content to evaluate conciseness.

**Status:** ⚠️ Justificativas diferem

## HOW INSTALLATION

### Notas (Quality Metrics)

| Métrica | Gemini | Manual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| clarity | 3 | 2 | ⚠️ |
| readability | 3 | 1 | ⚠️ |
| structure | 2 | 3 | ⚠️ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> The README does not provide direct installation commands, which forces users to navigate away immediately. Only a general statement about supporting 'all popular operating systems' is present, without specific version requirements or prerequisites. No explicit dependencies are listed, although 'built to work with NumPy arrays' implies NumPy as a core dependency.

**Manual:**
> Logical placement, but content is only a pointer. No inline commands to read or copy. Clear that installation info exists, but README fails to provide it directly.

**Status:** ⚠️ Justificativas diferem

## HOW USAGE

### Notas (Quality Metrics)

| Métrica | Gemini | Manual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| code_readability | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| effectiveness | 1 | 1 | ✅ |
| understandability | 1 | 1 | ✅ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> There are no usage examples or code snippets provided in the README, making it impossible to understand practical application directly. As no code is present, code readability cannot be assessed. The absence of usage examples significantly reduces the README's effectiveness in demonstrating how to use the library immediately.

**Manual:**
> Impossible to grasp practical usage from README alone. No code to assess readability. Lack of MWE hinders quick onboarding.
