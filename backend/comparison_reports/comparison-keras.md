| readability | 5 | 5 | ✅ |
| structure | 5 | 5 | ✅ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> The installation section is very well-structured with clear sub-sections for pip, local, and GPU installations. Commands are provided in distinct code blocks and are easy to follow and reproduce. Compatibility requirements are clearly stated, including a detailed table for backend versions and OS recommendations.

**Manual:**

## HOW USAGE

### Notas (Quality Metrics)

| Métrica | Gemini | Manual | Status |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| code_readability | 3 | 1 | ⚠️ |
| effectiveness | 2 | 2 | ✅ |
| understandability | 2 | 2 | ✅ |

### Justificativas

**Gemini:**
> There is no comprehensive minimal working example that demonstrates how to build and train a Keras model from scratch. The code snippets provided are for backend configuration, not for illustrating typical model usage with explicit input and output. While 'Backwards compatibility' explains migration, it lacks concrete usage examples of a converted model performing a task.

**Manual:**
> Without an MWE, users must leave the README to grasp the basic workflow.
